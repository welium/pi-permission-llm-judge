 * Two vendor vocabularies express one intent: Anthropic, Google, Bedrock, and

 * (`"auto" | "none"`) governs `streamSimple`, not `complete` — each API module
 * declares its own accepted values, and those declarations are the contract
 * read here.
 *
 * Sending the wrong spelling does not fail loudly. `openai-completions`
 * forwards it verbatim, the endpoint discards it, the request degrades to
 * `"auto"`, and the model answers in prose — which is how a forced verdict tool
 * call comes to be silently unforced on OpenAI-compatible providers.
